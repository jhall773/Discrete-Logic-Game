They thought maybe they could get some extra coins from it perhaps to help them later down the line. Unfortuenately for them though, the game required you to gamble two coins of which were already in one's possession in order to obtain a third. So, as they were walking around, they noticed a boy, obviously looking longingly into the window of a bakery, starving.\nCrystine: Don't have enough, kiddo? (she says, noticing the coins in his palm)\nCrystine: Look, we really need a couple of coins right now for us to get some supplies. We're going on a long journey ok? We have some fruit and some bread here already. Giving us those coins in exchange for some of our food is probably be a lot more than what most others would make you pay for it. So what do you say?\nBoy: Psshh! How do you even know I have any coins, huh? Well (he reconsiders after his stomach makes another growl), how about this? Let's say I did have some coins. I have an odd number or an even number of them. I'll let you know now that I don't have an even number of coins. So, do I have an odd or an even number of them? If you can figure out the answer, then I'll share them with you (He said this, thinking in his naiveness as a little boy that he made a rather difficult and clever game for them).\n");

We're definitley not from around here...-and um-,unforteounately sir, -we weren't aware that there would be any kind of fee.\nGuard: (Makes a suggestion after pondering for a while) Well, I guess I got some extra change to spare. It would be nice to have some company here, since thre usually aren't a whole lot of people around when we're not in rush hour. I'd say they pay me pretty well here. So I tell you what.

Eventually though, it got time for Zeke and Crystine to give an answer.\nGuard: Alright now, the gate is gonna close soon for the night. You kiddos shouldn't be up too late after dark anyway.

(He  after seeing the large \"RETIRED\" sign outside the door, cracking up at the remark in his second sentence)\nCrystine: This shop is probably also this man's home. I sure he wanted to live in peace Zeke, and too many people kept bothering him thinking becasue he was home that he was in buisiness to help them with all their gadgets and such.\nZeke: Gadgets?\nCrystine: You can't tell? Look at all those clocks and old machines. All those old tools lying around inside too. He must've been a tinker, a fix-it maestro of some kind. And he must've been a pretty good one considering the sign on his door. Narrator: Crystine decides to give the door a little knock.\nA well aged gentleman with some glasses only fitting for a Tinker answered the door.\nTanner: Well hello there kiddos? What can I do for you today, eh? And uh, I'm actually retired from my tinkering days, so I hope you weren't looking for anything on that end, but I might be able to get you guys something or get you to someone who can help.\nCrystine: Well thank you kind sir, but actually, we were told from a nice couple in the last town that you might be able to direct us to the King of this land. We know it's not likely for us to see him, but we have something very importiant to inquire him about. An inquiry so very importiant that we are hoping to give to him in person.\nTanner: (Supprised by these young persons speaking boldly with so much courage about inquirring the king) Oh my. Well, he is a very difficult man to reach from what I hear. Far from here I would say, but... probably not \"longitudinal\" in the way you would think. Why don't you kids come on inside for a bit. Just be sure not to touch anything around here ok? The machines and some of the inventions and gadgets Iv've been trying to work on a a little figgity. You know, \"works in progress\" that stopped being in, -well, progress.\nCrystine: Yes, thank you for the invitation sir. WE COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. RIGHT BROTHER?!

Why would I want to mess with someone's dingy old stuff that doesn't even work anyway!\nCrystine: ZEKE!\nTanner: Oh it's alright. It's not the kid's fault I lost my tinkering touch. Don't murder the boy. (He says jokingly)\nOf course, after the three of them sit down at one of his old coffe tables that he built himself, turning it into a table full of drafts and laid out tools with bearly anywhere to put a mug, Zeke goes looking and wanderring around, charmed by the old machinery and gadgets and tools surrounding him like a kid in a candy store. And jsut as any mischevious little brother would, he starts fiddling and playing with some of it, fortunately not casuing much complication due to half of the inventions either being turned off or so being inoperable that they acted just the same as if it were so. Howvever, there was one particular machine that caught his eye. One that had a little movement of little side metal pieces that almost seems the resemble the flapping of wings of some sort. So he started pressing diffrent buttons and playing with the lever, altering the flapp patterns and even how wide or narrow the wings swung out. Soon after he hit a button or two and started messing with the crank though, the invention started to malfunction and bring about smoke.\nZeke: Hey sir! I think your bird thingi is about to blow or something!\nCrystine: ZEEEEKKKKEEEE! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU COULDN'T JUST STAY PUT FOR FIVE MUNUTES AND-\nTanner: It's alright it's alright. (He tries to calm everyone down) We do need to stop that thing though before something bad really does happen. All you have to do is press the exact buttons you did before and it'll shut it down kiddo! You got that?!\nZeke: Yeah, uh...-I wasn't really paying attention to that...\nCrstine: \"WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT?!\" JUST LIKE YOU WEREN'T \"PAYING ATTENTION\" WHEN WE TOLD YOU TO KEEP YOUR STICKY FINGERS AWAY FROM THIS STUFF! (After the increasing thickness of the smoke reminded her that more fussing wasn't going to do them any good) DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT YOU DID WITH THIS THING AT ALL?\nZeke: Well, I know that \"I know fore sure that I pushed more than one button\". \"I didn't push any two buttons right next to each other\". And, uhm...-One of the buttons I that I pressed was green.\nCrystine: That's it?!\nZeke: Yeah. I'm serious, ok?! Crystine: (Noticing the four buttons on the machine in this order: RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE) Hm...-I'm sure there must be a logical way to think about this...There's four buttons over there, so sixteen possibilities for buttons pressed, including none of the four, or all four of them...At least eight of those possibilities couldn't work because they would all have buttons pressed next to each other.

You kids figured it out didn't you. I can tell, you kids must have some good heads on your shoulders. Well now, since you kids figured out how to stop that bum thing, why don't I give you one better, huh? (He goes in a back room and fumbles around before finding some old glider wings he designed.

Since you kids are still pretty small, the large straps ought to ba able to fit both of you, and ought to be able to pick you right up! The only thing is though, I didn't have enough time to do the last little bit of programming on it. You see, in order to make a button for the wings to fly you up when it gets pressed, you need to make an algebraic expression out of Boolean logic for the case where you guys shut that other machine down. But I tested the physical side of it already. And hey, you kids are pretty sharp so, you guys ought to be able to figure something out. (He goes on to elaborate more on what he meant earlier when he said that the King's quarters was \"far\", but not \"in the longitudinal\" sense. He explains that the King's palace is on a hundreds of miles high mountain that is nearly inpossible to physically climb, and suggesting that his glider should help with the physical impracticality of getting them up there.)\nCrystine: Thank you for your gift and encouraging sentiments sir!\nZeke: Yeah.

You need to chill bro. We haven't even programmed the equation yet for the fly button, remember?\nZeke: Oh yeah, that's right.\nCrystine: I guess we need to figure out how to logically make an equation for what you did with that Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue button (in that order) to start and stop that machine.\nZeke: Hm...Well it seems like we just need to \"AND\" together variables representing the \"pressed\" logic state of every button and negate two of the variables for the variables representing \"yellow\" and \"blue\".
